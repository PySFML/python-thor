=========
So far, no packages or installers are provided so you'll have to
compile it by yourself.

These bindings need Cython 0.18 to be compiled and a simple ::

    python setup.py install

should do the work if pySFML is properly installed.

.. warning::

	The above instructions are for Unix systems if you want to compile on
	Windows you'll have to figure out by yourself. It shouldn't be that
	complicated, minor changes to setup.py and a good understanding on how
	to distribute Python extensions using Cython is enough.
