About
=====
This is version 1.0 of the binding for `Thor <http://www.bromeon.ch/libraries/thor/index.html>`_ 
released under the `zlib/libpng <http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib>`_ license.

By combining the strength of SFML and its extensions with the ease of the 
Python language, we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia 
software.

.. note ::

        So far, these bindings have only been tested thoroughly on Linux,
        though minimal testing has been done on Windows.

Getting the Code

After you've installed `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, you may issue
the following command to obtain the source::
