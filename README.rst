About
=====
This is version 1.0 of the binding for `Thor <http://www.bromeon.ch/libraries/thor/index.html>`_ 
released under the `zlib/libpng <http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib>`_ license.

Python bindings really are the perfect way to sketch software using SFML.

By combining the strength of SFML and its extensions with the ease of the 
Python language, we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia 
software.

.. note ::

        So far, these bindings have only been tested thoroughly on Linux,
        though minimal testing has been done on Windows.

Getting the Code
================
After you've installed `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, you may issue
the following command to obtain the source::

    git clone git@github.com:Sonkun/python-thor.git
    cd python-sfml
